We cross-country skiied to each location, and undertaking scientific observations - flock numbers, glacier retreat, slush floe beginnings. It was an amazing time, and I certainly 'found myself'. A couple of weeks after that, I headed to Costa Rica for a month. Slightly more relaxing I would say!",

That might have been a boast a number of years ago, but I think it's rather a warning now...<br>In my fourth and final year, I lived with a bunch of friends in a house on campus. We had a croquet lawn out the back, so needless to say there was a reduced amount of studing that year. My dad hadn't picked up his Oxford Masters (we all know it's not really a thing) so we actually graduated together!",

Unfortunately, the name is just a name, and nothing more...<br> Later on, he was the Conservative MP for North Islington, quite a time before Jeremy Corbyn!
